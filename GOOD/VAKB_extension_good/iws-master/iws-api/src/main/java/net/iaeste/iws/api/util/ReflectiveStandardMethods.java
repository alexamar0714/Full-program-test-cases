/**
 * <p>Boilerplate code should be avoided if possible, it clutters the classes,
 * reduces readability and is often a nuisance to test, as it often leads to
 * really bad tests, which simply exists to prove that something which is
 * generated should work.</p>
 *
 * <p>Using Reflection is coming with a price, so using a library to handle it,
 * can be tricky to get right, as there is no control over the library, so a
 * change can result in different expectations. Or it can be that it cannot be
 * controlled to the degree required. For example, things like sensitive data
 * should never be part of the generated toString value.</p>
 *
 * <p>This Class will try to handle these problems, by providing a
 * self-implemented, and yet fairly simple Reflective Solution. Although
 * Reflection is having a performance overhead over generated code, it also
 * has the beauty, that it will work even if a developer forgot to update the
 * standard methods.</p>
 *
 * <p>It should be noted, that libraries such as Apache Commons does provide
 * loads if nice functionality, but dragging around with it, is rather heavy,
 * and often only a fraction of the functionality is used. This doesn't mean
 * that such libraries should be avoided, but a balance must be struck, so
 * simple logic is handled directly, rather than via Libraries.</p>
 *
 * <p>The logic implemented in this class focuses on the following standard
 * methods:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>#equals(obj)</li>
 *   <li>#hashCode()</li>
 *   <li>#toString()</li>
 * </ul>
