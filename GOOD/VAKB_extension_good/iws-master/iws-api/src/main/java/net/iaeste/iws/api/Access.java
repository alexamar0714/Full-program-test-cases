/**
 * <p>Access to the IWS, requires a Session. This Interface, holds all required
 * functionality to properly work with a Session, which includes creating,
 * verifying, updating and deprecating them. Additionally, the method to fetch
 * the list of Permissions is also here.</p>
 *
 * <p>The usage of the IWS follows this flow:</p>
 * <pre>
 *     1. Create a new Session
 *     2. Iterate as long as desired
 *        a) Verify the users Session, returns the current Session Data
 *        b) Perform various actions against the IWS, using the Session
 *        c) If SessionData needs saving, save them
 *     3. Once work is completed, deprecate the Session
 * </pre>
 * <p>It is important to underline, that a User may only have 1 (one) active
 * Session at the time. Meaning, that the same user may not log into different
 * IWS based systems at the same time. This feature was added to prevent Account
 * misuse. Though the consequences of attempting will simply be a
 * rejection.</p>
 *
 * <p>The interface is annotated with the WebService annotations and XML
 * elements used by JAXB, although some are implicit so named, it is helpful to
 * explicitly set them, to avoid any future problems.</p>
