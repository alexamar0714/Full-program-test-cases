/**
 * The different types of Users we have. From IW3, the values were added as part
 * of release 1.13, and the following was found in the SQL update script:
 * <pre>
 *   ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN type VARCHAR(1);
 *   ALTER TABLE users ALTER COLUMN type SET DEFAULT 'v';
 *   CHANGE_NS users SET type =
 *     CASE
 *       WHEN volunteer = 't' THEN 'v'
 *       WHEN volunteer = 'f' THEN 'e'
 *       ELSE 'x'
 *     END;
 *   ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN volunteer;
 * </pre>
 * <p>Based on the above SQL changes, it is assumed that we have three types.
 * During the migration, it was discovered that 30 accounts were having type
 * 'x', interpreted as Unknown.</p>
 *
 * <p>In IWS, we've added two more types, student &amp; functional. which
 * complements the previous ones to provide a more suitable range of Accounts,
 * where rules can later be added to these, to improve internal data
 * management.</p>
