/**
 * <p>User Object, contain the system specific information related to a user,
 * and the personal details in the Person Object. Please note, that a user is
 * considered a vital Object in the system and cannot be deleted. The personal
 * details can be deleted.</p>
 *
 * <p>Since the username is the e-mail of a user which is subject to changes, it
 * is, of course, possible to change it - just as it is possible to change the
 * password. However, the name of a user cannot be altered. The system is
 * designed as a multi-user system, where it is possible to assign rights to
 * others. However, giving an account to another user by altering the name of
 * the user, can be very confusing, since older records are now suddenly owned
 * by a different person, who may not have had anything to do with the original
 * user.</p>
