/**
 * <p>Defines all Fields of Study together with their Specializations. Note,
 * these values are mapped into the database entities, and thus stored there. If
 * a value is changed. The reverse mapping (#valueOf()) will fail. It is
 * therefore *not* allowed to change the spelling of an existing entry, without
 * verification that it is not used in the database.</p>
 *
 * <p>If it is used in the database, then it can also be that it is used
 * elsewhere, i.e. by third-party systems - and if so, then the entry may no
 * longer be touched.</p>
 *
 * <p>As third-party systems may also use the enum, changes to the list may only
 * be added to the end, since the ordinal values of records may otherwise
 * change, again causing various problems. It is *not* allowed to delete any
 * records from this list.</p>
 *
 * <p>Dealing with deprecation of the records is still a pending topic, but as
 * it very rarely happens, this is more an academic topic than a practical
 * matter.</p>
 *
 * <p>The initial listing is generated from the SID provided Excel Sheet, see
 * Trac ticket #416.</p>
