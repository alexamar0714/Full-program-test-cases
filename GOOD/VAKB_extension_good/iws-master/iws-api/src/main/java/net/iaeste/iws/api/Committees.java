/**
 * <p>Control of National Committees and International Groups is done via the
 * functionality provided by this Interface.</p>
 *
 * <p>The IAESTE Committees consists of several different types, from Full
 * Members, Associate Members to Co-operating Institutions. Once a new member
 * is added, it starts out as a Co-operating Institution, it can then later be
 * upgraded to an Associate Member and later on Full Member. However, for some
 * Countries, it is not possible to make the step directly. The rule that
 * applies, is that a Country can only go from Co-Operating Institution state to
 * Associate Member state, if the Committees in the Country have consolidated,
 * meaning that there can be only one National Committee.</p>
 *
 * <p>Besides the Groups for Committees, there exists Global Groups in IAESTE,
 * these are referred to as International Groups. International Groups, is any
 * Group, which is not under the control of a single Country, but serves a
 * larger purpose. The standard International Groups includes the SID (Seminar
 * on IAESTE Development) and the IDT (IAESTE Internet Development Team). Other
 * International Groups may exists, which is not under the control of the Board,
 * this would include "Regional" groups, such as the CEC (Central European
 * Countries) or similar Groups.</p>

     * <p>Processing Committees, means create, update, merge/upgrade, activate,
     * suspend or delete National Groups, with their related Member Group as
     * well as control the National Secretary.</p>
     * <p>The Request is fairly complex, hence the Request Objects takes an
     * Action as a principal argument, which must be defined and the action to
     * be taken will depend on the Action given. The required data needed for
     * the processing also depends on the given Action.</p>
     * <ul>
     *   <li><b>Action: Create</b>
     *   <p>This Action is for creating new Cooperating Institutions, meaning
     *   create both a new Members Group and a new Staff. The request requires
     *   that the Country is set as well as Institution. And to ensure that a
     *   new National Secretary can be applied, the first and last name and
     *   username must all be applied. It is not possible to create a new
     *   Cooperating Institution with an existing user. The name of the
     *   Institution will be used to create the Abbreviation, which again serves
     *   as the Staff name and also public mail address.</p>
     *   Example:
     *     <pre>
     *     Country: Elbonia
     *     Institution: Super Tech
     *     </pre>
     *   Result:
     *     <pre>
     *     Staff: Elbonia, ST
     *     FullName: Elbonia, Super Tech
     *     Mail: <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="f2b79e909d9c9b93ada1a6b29b9397818697dc9d8095">[emailÂ protected]</a>
     *     </pre>
     *   Note; Attempting to add a Cooperating Institution to a Country which is
     *   already having status as Associate Member or Full Member will result in
     *   an error.
     *   </li>
     * </ul>
     * <ul>
     *   <li><b>Action: Change NS</b>
     *   <p>It is only allowed to change the National Secretary of an active
     *   Committee, as name changes will affect mailing lists and these are used
     *   as part of a Committee's official information.</p>
     *
     *   <p>The National Secretary can either be an existing member of the
     *   Committee, or a new user. Attempting to make a person from either a
     *   different committee or a global member the new National Secretary will
     *   result in an error.</p>
     *   </li>
     * </ul>
     * <ul>
     *   <li><b>Action: Merge</b>
     *   <p>To be decided by the Board.</p>
     *   </li>
     * </ul>
     * <ul>
     *   <li><b>Action: Upgrade</b>
     *   <p>Upgrades a Committee from Cooperating Institution to Associate
     *   Member (if only a single Committee exists in the Country) or from
     *   Associate Member to Full Member. Attempting to upgrade a Cooperating
     *   Institution where two or more Committees exists or attempting to
     *   upgrade a Full Member will result in an error.</p>
     *   </li>
     * </ul>
     * <ul>
     *   <li><b>Action: Activate</b>
     *   <p>Activates a previously Suspended Committee, meaning that both the
     *   Member and National Groups will have their status changed to Active.
     *   Attempting to Activate something else will result in an error.</p>
     *
     *   <p>Note; Activation of a Committee, means that all accounts that belongs
     *   to it, will also be reactivated.</p>
     *   </li>
     * </ul>
     * <ul>
     *   <li><b>Action: Suspend</b>
     *   <p>Suspends an already Active Committee, meaning that both the Member
     *   and National Groups will have their status changed to Suspended.
     *   Attempting to Suspend something else will result in an error.</p>
     *
     *   <p>Note; All accounts currently belonging to the Suspended Committee,
     *   will also be suspended. All new accounts will be deleted, as they also
     *   should not be allowed to function.</p>
     *   </li>
     * </ul>
     * <ul>
     *   <li><b>Action: Delete</b>
     *   <p>Deletes a previously suspended Committee, meaning that all Members
     *   will be removed, as will all subgroups, and internal data - leaving
     *   only the stubs and already published information that is important for
     *   other Committees, like Offers, and shared Students. Attempting to
     *   delete an Active Committee will result in an error.</p>
     *
     *   <p>All accounts belonging to the Committee will also be deleted from
     *   the system. All sub-groups, like WorkGroups and Local Committees will
     *   also be deleted together with their data.</p>
