 * <p>All DTOs, Requests and Response Classes, which is considered basic
 * classes, must all implement some standard functionality, such as the equals
 * and hashCode methods as well as toString. This annotation is designed to act
 * as a way to control what will be part of which implementation, so rather than
 * having some very complex logic in the classes, we can simplify it with a set
 * of standard methods, which via Reflection is implementing the
 * functionality.</p>
 *
 * <p>Any class containing this annotation will automatically be a standard
 * Class, meaning that if the method is present, the fields will all
 * automatically be included, unless implicitly annotated with one of the
 * alternative For values.</p>
