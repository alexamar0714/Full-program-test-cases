 * When reading multiple records from the system, it must be possible to sort
 * these according to the user requesting it. Since sorting is a field that
 * cannot be set dynamically, the queries must then either be constructed from
 * the ground up using CriteriaBuilder, or we have to move the control into the
 * Service Classes, which should not care for it. Instead, the solution that we
 * implement Comparable, and let it be customized according to the sorting
 * field used, seems to be the best solution, as it means that we have the
 * control in the Entities - where the Query control already resides.
