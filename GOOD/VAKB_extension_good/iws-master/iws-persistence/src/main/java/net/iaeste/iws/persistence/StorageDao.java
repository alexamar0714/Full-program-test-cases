    /**
     * The IWS Folder Structure is based on the Adjacency Tree Model [1]. This
     * is a fairly simple construction, where each node is having a reference
     * to a parent.<br />
     *   Problem here, is to find all the nodes from a branch and down to the
     * root, so we can verify the permissions. To do so, we need to recursively
     * lookup the Tree using the given Id. Doing a recursive lookup by iterating
     * over the elements is not a good idea, it is very performance costly, so
     * instead a solution with a minimal amount of Database Activity is
     * required.<br />
     *   SQL:1999 is having a nice solution ready called Common Table Expression
     * or CTE [2]. This is supported by the majority of DBMS, but is not mapped
     * into JPA! So, rather than using JPA to have an elegant solution, we must
     * instead use a native Query. Only problem with using a Native Query is
     * that we cannot utilize the JPA based prepared statement, instead we have
     * to revert to injecting the Id directly into the Query :-(<br />
     *   Luckily we're saved by the fact that all input validation is in place
     * and the given Id must be valid - this way we can safely run the Query,
     * but with the hope that next generation JPA will have support for Common
     * Table Expressions. It should be noted that some JPA tricks exist [3], but
     * they do not seem to work with our data model.<br />
     *   Note; that although PostgreSQL have had support for CTE for quite a
     * while, HyperSQL is a different story [4].
