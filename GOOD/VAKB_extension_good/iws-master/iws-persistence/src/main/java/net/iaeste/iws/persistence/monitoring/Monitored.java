 * Monitoring, and secondly to the fields as well.<br />
 *   The enum {@code MonitoringLevel} contains details about how the monitoring
 * is applied and interpreted by the {@code MonitoringProcessor}. However, the
 * processor will only look at Types (Classes) and Fields which have this
 * annotation added - everything else is skipped.
