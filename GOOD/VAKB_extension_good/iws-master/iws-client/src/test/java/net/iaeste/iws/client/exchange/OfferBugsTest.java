    /**
     * During the 2015 Annual Conference an Offer was inserted in into the IW,
     * and caused subsequent problems as it contained 5 Specializations,
     * although only 3 is allowed. After inquiring the delegation who created
     * the Offer, they informed that they had read the CSV upload documentation
     * stating that the Specializations must be delimited by pipes "|". So
     * instead of using the normal Form in IW4 to upload the offers, they added
     * all of them with pipes.<br />
     *   The result was that the Offer DTO had a set of Strings with only one
     * value (the delimited specializations), thus omitting the standard checks
     * in the Offer DTO. When inserted. the Set is expanded into a pipe "|"
     * delimited String and that all worked fine, but reading it out again
     * caused an error.<br />
     *   This test is replicating the issue and will demonstrate the flaw, and
     * also the fix. For more information, see Trac ticket #971 (#966).
