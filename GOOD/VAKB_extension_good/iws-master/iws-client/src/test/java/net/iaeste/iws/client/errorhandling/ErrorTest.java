 * The IWSError Object is causing a problem due to the fact that it is both an
 * Object and a Constant. Meaning, that comparison using either "==" or
 * ".equals()" are working. The reference comparison ("=="), is incorrect, since
 * it only checks that the pointer references are the same. For this reason, the
 * IWS Exception is using deep copying to return a true copy, which will make
 * the reference comparison fail.
