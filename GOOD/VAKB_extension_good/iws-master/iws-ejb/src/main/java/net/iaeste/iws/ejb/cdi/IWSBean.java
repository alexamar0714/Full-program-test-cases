/**
 * CDI excepts that all classes are uniquely identifiable, using type checks. If
 * multiple beans exists of the same type, then it is not able to correctly find
 * and inject this. By introducing a new Annotation for our Beans, it is
 * possible to better control what Bean is expected. CDI is used for both the
 * Bean definition, and for the Bean injection, to better control it.<br />
 *   The annotation takes a type as value, which is then used to uniquely
 * identify the Bean. For more information about this approach, please see the
 * Blog from <a href="http://antoniogoncalves.org/2011/04/07/injection-with-cdi-part-i/">Antonia goncalves</a>.
