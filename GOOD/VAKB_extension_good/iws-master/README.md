### The IntraWeb Services Project

The IWS was initiated in 2011 and development began in 2012. It was designed
to replace the existing backend system for the [IAESTE](http://www.iaeste.org/) [IntraWeb](https://www.iaeste.net/), and additionally
add a new public API, to properly facilitate automated interaction for the many
Committees around the world.

IWS was designed as a pure JavaEE 6 Application later upgraded to JavaEE 7,
written in Java 7. It has been tested to run under [WildFly](http://wildfly.org/), [JBoss](http://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/jboss-middleware) & [Glassfish](https://glassfish.java.net/). To build,
please check out the sources and run the Maven build command. Note that only
Configuration files for [WildFly](http://wildfly.org/) has been created, and can be found in the
iws-accessories folder.
