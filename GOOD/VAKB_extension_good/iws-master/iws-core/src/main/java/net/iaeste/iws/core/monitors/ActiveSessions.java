/**
 * There is a number of issues that has to be resolved for our Session handling,
 * this includes expiring of Sessions, avoiding that too many sessions currently
 * are active (since it may overload the system), and we also wish to have
 * certain requests made read-only.<br />
 *   First, an inactive User should be kicked out when no longer using the
 * system, these sessions are considered expired. The main reason for doing so,
 * is simply to avoid that someone can misuse an open Session.<br />
 *   Second, the idea behind this logic, is also to add some safe-guards against
 * DDOS attacks, by not invoking the database needlessly. Hence the map is
 * purely living in-memory. Combined with the multi-login attempt prevention, it
 * may hopefully keep the system from going down.
 *   Third, some of the requests are made purely read-only. This basically
 * applies to all requests called "fetch...". Since these only need to read
 * content from the database, and can thus be invoked using database
 * views.<br />
 *   This class is made as a Singleton, since all threads should be able to read
 * the same information out. It would make little sense to add a Session safe
 * guard, if different threads were not sharing the information.
