JPA-Unit follows the [GitHub's fork and pull model](https://help.github.com/articles/about-collaborative-development-models/). 
To get started, just fork the JPA-Unit repository to your GitHub account. Once you've done with your change, submit a
[pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).

When contributing, please follow the following practices:
- Use feature branch for each feature bugfix you want to contribute.
- Write test cases (unit & integration tests) to ensure the functionality is working as expected and to avoid loss of functionality 
  in future development cycles. Make sure the code coverage in not below 80%.
- Create one pull request per feature/bugfix.
- Make sure your pull request has a meaningful history (squash intermediary commits into logical chunks before submitting a pull request).
- Rebase against master often. If your pull request is stale it can't be merged.
 
Last, but not least, discuss new features/bugfixes you'd like to contribute at the [JPA-Unit's issue tracker](https://github.com/dadrus/jpa-unit/issues) 
before getting started.
